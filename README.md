## App Sections

### Dashboard

The home screen after launch. Displays:

- **Stats bar** — Total tests taken, practice time (hours), best band score, date of last test
- **Skill progress** — A progress bar for each of the four IELTS skills, calculated from test history
- **Quick-start buttons** — Jump directly into any section or a full test
- **Recent tests** — The 5 most recent test records

All stats are computed from localStorage history. Use **Reset All Data** (with confirmation) to clear everything.

---

### Mock Test

#### Selecting a Test

1. Choose a **Test Package** (e.g., Cambridge IELTS 18) from the dropdown
2. Choose a **Test** (Test 1, Test 2, …)
3. Choose a **Timer Mode**: Countdown or Elapsed
4. Click one of the five section cards to start

#### Test Interface

- **Timer bar** — Fixed to the top. Turns yellow under 10 minutes, red under 5 minutes, and pulses in the final minute. Countdown mode auto-submits when time reaches zero.
- **Listening player bar** — Appears only during listening tests. Shows the section title, persistent audio controls, and auto-seeks to the question's assigned timestamp when you navigate to a question that has one.
- **Jump-to buttons (⏱)** — Small circular icon buttons placed inline next to each question number. Clicking one seeks the audio to that question's start timestamp. Only shown when the question has a `questionStart` value set in the admin panel.
- **Reading split pane** — Passage on the left, questions on the right, independently scrollable.
- **Question navigator** — Fixed at the bottom. Click any number to jump to that question. Color legend: grey = unanswered, green = answered, orange = flagged.
- **Flag button** — Marks the current question for review. Flagged questions appear orange in the navigator.

#### Submitting

Click **Submit Test** → confirm in the modal. Results show:
- Overall band score (3.5–9.0)
- Correct / total questions and accuracy percentage
- Time taken
- Breakdown by question type

Click **Save to History** to record the result. It will appear in the Dashboard and Review tabs.

---

### Practice

Three difficulty levels: **Beginner** (Band 4–5), **Intermediate** (Band 5.5–6.5), **Advanced** (Band 7+).

Each package has five sub-tabs:

| Sub-tab | Content |

| **Vocabulary** | Word cards (definition, part of speech, example) + a matching quiz |
| **Grammar** | Accordion sections per topic — rule explanations + fill-in practice questions with instant feedback |
| **Reading Skills** | Strategy guides for skimming, scanning, inference, etc. |
| **Writing Tips** | Task 1 & Task 2 strategy breakdown with band-score badges and model answers |
| **Mini Quiz** | 20-question quiz covering vocabulary, grammar, reading, and writing |

---

### Review

- **Score Trend Chart** — Canvas line chart showing up to 10 most recent tests. Each section has its own colored line. Bands 3.5–9.0 are gridded.
- **Test History** — Full list of saved tests. Click any row to expand it and see:
  - Band score, correct/total, time taken
  - Personalized advice based on your band for that section

Use **Clear History** to delete all records.

### Admin Panel

## Adding Test Content

### Editing Built-in Content (Cambridge IELTS 18)

The built-in data lives in `js/data-test.js` and `js/data-cam18.js`. You can:

1. **Edit via Admin Panel** — changes are saved to localStorage and override the file data
2. **Edit the source files directly** — edit `TEST_PACKAGES` in `data-test.js` / `data-cam18.js`

### Adding a New Test Package via Source

In `js/data-test.js`, extend `TEST_PACKAGES`:

```javascript
TEST_PACKAGES['my_package'] = {
  id: 'my_package',
  name: 'My Test Package',
  tests: {
    'test1': {
      id: 'test1',
      name: 'Test 1',
      reading: {
        passages: [
          {
            id: 'p1',
            title: 'Passage Title',
            body: 'Passage text...',
            questions: [
              { id: 'q1', qNum: 1, type: 'tfng', text: 'Question text', answer: 'TRUE' },
              { id: 'q2', qNum: 2, type: 'mcq', text: 'Question?', options: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], answer: 'A' }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      listening: {
        sections: [
          {
            id: 's1',
            title: 'Section 1',
            audio: 'Resources/audio.mp3',
            transcript: 'Transcript text...',
            questions: [
              { id: 'q10', qNum: 10, type: 'short', text: 'Fill in:', answer: 'word', questionStart: 45 }
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      writing: {
        task1: { prompt: 'Describe the chart...' },
        task2: { prompt: 'Discuss both views...' }
      },
      speaking: {
        parts: [
          { part: 1, title: 'Introduction', prompts: ['Tell me about...'] }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Listening Question `questionStart`

The `questionStart` field (integer, seconds) controls:
- **Auto-seek** — the audio player jumps to this timestamp when the user navigates to that question
- **Jump button** — a small ⏱ icon appears inline next to the question number; clicking it manually seeks to the timestamp

Set this in the Admin Panel using the **Capture** button while previewing the audio, or set it directly in the data file as an integer (e.g., `questionStart: 47`).

### Grouped Listening Questions

To render multiple questions as a single block (map, flow chart, table, etc.):

```javascript
// All questions sharing a groupId are rendered together
{ id: 'q1', qNum: 1, type: 'map_labelling', groupId: 'map_group1', groupImage: 'map.png', xPct: 30, yPct: 45, text: 'The library', answer: 'B', questionStart: 120 },
{ id: 'q2', qNum: 2, type: 'map_labelling', groupId: 'map_group1', groupImage: 'map.png', xPct: 60, yPct: 20, text: 'The café', answer: 'D' },
```

Only the first question in a group needs `questionStart` — its ⏱ button appears inline with that question.

## Technical Notes

- **No framework, no build step.** Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Open `app.html` in a browser and it works.
- **State** is held in the global `appState` object in memory. Nothing is sent to a server.
- **CSS custom properties** (`--primary`, `--card-bg`, etc.) are defined in `shared.css`. The full kawaii theme is controlled from there.
- **Responsive breakpoints:** the reading split-pane and stats grid adapt below 900px; the question navigator and timer bar are always visible on mobile.
- **Audio files** for Cambridge IELTS 18 are in `Resources/Cam18/Cam18_Audio/`. Audio URLs in the data files are relative paths from `app.html`.
- **Cambridge IELTS 18 Tests 2–4** are structurally wired up in `data-cam18.js` but the question content is not yet filled in (marked with `TODO` comments).
